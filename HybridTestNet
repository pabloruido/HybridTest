The bridge between chains also works very fast, I would say it is surprising, perhaps something to fix is ​​the message that appears in metamask when sending from the Hybrid testnet, since it says "sending ETH" when we are sending Hyb.

The chat with Atlas works well, obviously there may be things that still need to be loaded with more information, but the sending of "HYB" 
is fast and the response too, apparently without bugs, except when Metamask is connected and it also asks to connect a hyb account, 
when you connect Google, it tells you that you do not have funds for the requirement.
